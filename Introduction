1st line of a java code would be in which package the code we are writing .
All the codes in java are written within a class, and class name and file name would be same .

Extention for a java file is .java .
Comments in java are written after //  and for multiline comment /* */.

To print something in java we write 
    System.out.println("Hello World");
We can also use print here the only difference is that if we use println there would be an extra new line space and if we use print there wouldn't .

**** If we use sout and then tab it would give the output line and you don't have to wirte the whole line again and again .****

If we need to store something in a temporary memory then we use variables.
Just like C language we need to specify the data type of a variable as what we are storing in that variable.
We can assign the value a variable have to another variable.
