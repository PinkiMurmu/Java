Java is a high level language.
It is a portable language which can be run on any system as long as the system has JRE(Java runtime Environment).
1st line of the code is the package name in which we are writing the code.
After writing the java source code when the compiler gets to compile it, it would convert it to byte code(.class) which every system would understand.

////Function////
    That part of the code to which we say to perform the work.

////Class////
    It is a large entity in which we can write many function.
Among the classes the function named main() will be executed at the very first.
All the codes in java are written within a class, and class name and file name would be same .

Extention for a java file is .java .
Comments in java single line comment is written after //  and for multiline comment /* */.

To print something in java we write :
    System.out.println("Hello World");
We can also use print here the only difference is that if we use println there would be an extra new line space just the same as when we use \n it would give you an extra line and if we use print there wouldn't .

**** If we use [sout and then tab] it would give the output line, and you don't have to wirte the whole line again and again .****

If we need to store something in a temporary memory then we use variables.
Just like C language we need to specify the data type of a variable as what we are storing in that variable.
We can assign the value a variable have to another variable.
Java data types:
    Primitive - int, float, long int, byte, char, boolean, double (length/capacity is fixed -128 to 127)
    Non primitive - String, array, class, object, interface (length/capacity is not fixed)

Conditional Statements :
    if, else, else if, switch, break
These are the keywords . Keywords are those which have a fixed meaning in java, we cannot make it a variable name or make any other meaning of it .
    We use the conditional statements when we need an stoppage over something .
Break is used when we need to get out of the conditional statements . 
Switch is used to make conditional statements also.


Loops :
    for loop, while loop, do while loop
Loop is the part of the code which we need to execute more than 1 time .
for loop syntax is:
        for(initialization; condition; updation){}
    - If we don't give the condition, it would turn into infinite(never ending) loop which won't stop until the memory is full . We should ignore this .
while loop syntax is:
        while(cond){}
do-while loop syntax is:
        do{statement}while(cond)
The main difference of do-while loop over any other looping statement is that even if the condition satisfies or not it would execute at least once .
It checks the condition after executing once .
    We can also use loops inside loops which are called nested loops .

/// String///

Length of a  string variable is determined by the .length() function.
To see the character of a specific index we use .charAt() ufnction.
To replace a character in a string we use .replace() function.  - This function won't change the original string but will reflect the changes in the new string.
In java strings are immutable.
We can get a part of a large string by using the .substring() function.  - Inside the parenthesis there would be a lower limit and a upper limit, the lower limit would be included but upper limit wouldn't. It would be upper limit-1.

We can take inputs in java by scanner class for which we need to import java.util.* . It is a package where many codes are written which we would be using in our code .

We can give inputs by 
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String name = sc.next();
        System.out.println(name);
    - Here next() takes only the first token(word) . To print the full sentence we need to replace next() by nextLine() . There are many more .

///Arrays///

To start with array we need to include a package Java.util.Arrays  .

To declare an array we first write the data type of the array and the square bracket then the name we want to give to the array.
Then new and the length within the square bracket and the data type of the array.
If we try to print the array variable in java, it won't give the combination of hash code and class name. 
If you don't initialize a variable with any value it will by default initialize itself with null value or 0 for int, false for boolean.

When we are looking for the length of a string we need to put the parenthesis after the .length() like this.
Bu when we are checking an array length we don't need to put the parenthesis, it is the array property.
There is a class Arrays in array in which there is a function .sort() which would sort the array in ascending order.

2D arrays
initialize by the data type and two square brackets one after another.

////Casting////

It is to change from one form to another.
If we try to put a int value in a double it is possible but the reverse is not possible.
It can be of two types:
        Implicit - If we are putting a smaller value to a bigger container.
        Explicit - We will put the larger value to a smaller container by changing its data type as long as they are compatible. It will eliminate/truncate the after decimal numbers.

We can change the value of a variable in java.
We can make constants in java by the final keyword and after  declaring that we can't change the value of that variable.

/////Operators/////

There are four types of operators in java:
    Arithmatic operator(+,-,*,/,%(Modulo))
    Assignment operator(=,+=,-=,*=,/=,%=), Unary operator(++,-- )
    Logical operator
    Comparision operator

There is a Math class which is used to perform any kind of mathematical concepts. Like finding the minimum or maximum numbers of given numbers.

There is a random function in Math class which returns a random value between 0.0 to 1.0 in the form of long.
The value random returns is always less than 1, so if we typecast it to int, it will always show 0.
