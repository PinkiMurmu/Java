1st line of a java code would be in which package the code we are writing .
All the codes in java are written within a class, and class name and file name would be same .

Extention for a java file is .java .
Comments in java are written after //  and for multiline comment /* */.

To print something in java we write 
    System.out.println("Hello World");
We can also use print here the only difference is that if we use println there would be an extra new line space and if we use print there wouldn't .

**** If we use sout and then tab it would give the output line and you don't have to wirte the whole line again and again .****

If we need to store something in a temporary memory then we use variables.
Just like C language we need to specify the data type of a variable as what we are storing in that variable.
We can assign the value a variable have to another variable.
Java types:
    Primitive - int, float, long int, byte (length/capacity is fixed -128 to 127)
    Non primitive - String (length/capacity is not fixed)


/// String///

Length of a  string variable is determined by the .length() function.
To see the character of a specific index we use .charAt() ufnction.
To replace a character in a string we use .replace() function.  - This function won't change the original string but will reflect the changes in the new string.
In java strings are immutable.
We can get a part of a large string by using the .substring() function.  - Inside the parenthesis there would be a lower limit and a upper limit, the lower limit would be included but upper limit wouldn't. It would be upper limit-1.


///Arrays///
